    <h2>Hearthstone</h2>
    <p><a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/ko-kr" 
        target="_blank" title="Hearthstone Official Website">Hearthstone</a> is a 
        free-to-play online digital collectible card game 
        developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Originally subtitled 
        Heroes of Warcraft, Hearthstone builds upon the existing lore of the Warcraft 
        series by using the same elements, characters, and relics.</p>
    <p>Whether they’re minions, spells, quests, or heroes, 
        Hearthstone’s cards can dramatically change the game
        with powerful effects and crazy interactions.
