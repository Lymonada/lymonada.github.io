        target="_blank" title="League of Legends Official Website">League of Legends</a> (LoL), 
        commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game 
        developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom 
        map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same 
        genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized 
        through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.</p>
