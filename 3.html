    <h2>Baba is You</h2>
    <p><a href="https://hempuli.com/baba/" 
        target="_blank" title="Baba is You Official Website">Baba is You</a> is a puzzle 
        video game created by Finnish independent developer Arvi Teikari (known professionally
         as Hempuli). The game centers around the manipulation of "rules"—represented in the play 
         area by movable tiles with words written on them—in order to allow the player character, 
         usually the titular Baba, to reach a specified goal. Originating as a short demo built for
          the 2017 Nordic Game Jam, the game was expanded and released on 13 March 2019 for PC and
           Nintendo Switch. Mobile versions were released in June 2021.</p>
